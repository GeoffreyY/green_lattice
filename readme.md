## Installation

1. Install a userscript extension such as greasemonkey or tampermonkey: http://tampermonkey.net

2. Click: https://expyron.github.io/green_lattice/lattice.user.js

**NOTE:** If you get a bunch of code instead of it installing, you can copy and paste the code as a new script in greasemonkey/tampermonkey.
